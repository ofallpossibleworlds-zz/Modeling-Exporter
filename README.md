# Modeling-Exporter
A GUI for the genetic modeling algorithm created in Dr. Jon Silva's Lab

This is a user interface for the protein modeling algoritm for Dr. Jon Silva's Lab at Washington University in St. Louis.
While the interface itself was created using Qt's community resources, and as such is distributed openly under the GNU
public license, the algorithm itself was not, and will not appear here.

This application is intended to read and write files for the algorithm, but could be modified for many applications involving
pCLAMP software and file types. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about how it reads or stores the pCLAMP
data, or how to modify it for your own use.
